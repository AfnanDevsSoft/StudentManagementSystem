✅ All other source files

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED CLEANUP STEPS:

OPTION 1: Conservative (Keep everything, minimal risk)
- Do nothing, project works fine as-is
- Risk: Bloated codebase, slower builds

OPTION 2: Moderate (Clean up obviously unused)
- Remove demo views that are never accessed
- Estimated size reduction: 60-70%
- Risk: Very low - these are isolated demo files

OPTION 3: Aggressive (Full cleanup)
- Remove all demo views including edge case files
- Estimated size reduction: 74%
- Risk: Low - need to verify no broken routes
